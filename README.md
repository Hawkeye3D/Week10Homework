# Week10Homework
This was a very long assignment, too long in my opinion. I think there is a lack of clarity in some of the questions, and that is an issue in accelerated learning.
With regard to the assignment, I did not test the FLASK part, as I was busy with work, but did rough it out in code.  I figure we will be learning better ways of doing it soon, anyway.

I did the additional assignment.
